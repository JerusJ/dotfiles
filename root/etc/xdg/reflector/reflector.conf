# Reflector configuration file for the systemd service.

#
# Empty lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored.  All other lines should
# contain valid reflector command-line arguments. The lines are parsed with
# Python's shlex modules so standard shell syntax should work. All arguments are
# collected into a single argument list.
#
# See "reflector --help" for details.
#
# NOTE(jesse): enable/start:
# `sudo systemctl enable --now reflector`
